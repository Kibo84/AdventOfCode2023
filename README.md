## What is Advent of Code?

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual programming event that offers daily challenges from December 1st to 25th. Each day, a new problem is released that you can solve using your programming skills.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by days, with each day represented by a numbered folder (`day1`, `day2`, etc.). Inside each folder, you'll find the source code for the solution in Kotlin and possibly additional files depending on the requirements of the problem.

## My Solutions

These solutions are brought to you by [Kibo84](https://github.com/Kibo84). Feel free to explore and compare solutions!

## Acknowledgments

I appreciate the Advent of Code community for providing these stimulating challenges, and the Kotlin community for being a great source of inspiration.

I hope you find these solutions helpful, and have a joyful Advent of Code 2023!
