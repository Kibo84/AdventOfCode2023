# Advent of Code 2023 - Day 1: Trebuchet?!

## Part Two

### Updated Problem Description

Your calculation isn't quite right. It looks like some of the digits are actually spelled out with letters: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine also count as valid "digits".

Equipped with this new information, you now need to find the real first and last digit on each line. For example:

```plaintext
- two1nine => Calibration value: 29
- eightwothree => Calibration value: 83
- abcone2threexyz => Calibration value: 13
- xtwone3four => Calibration value: 24
- 4nineeightseven2 => Calibration value: 42
- zoneight234 => Calibration value: 14
- 7pqrstsixteen => Calibration value: 76
```

In this example, the calibration values are 29, 83, 13, 24, 42, 14, and 76. Adding these together produces 281.

**What is the sum of all the calibration values?**
